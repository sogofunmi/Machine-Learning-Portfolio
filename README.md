# Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio

This is a collection of data science and machine learning projects I completed for self-learning purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.
## Contents
  - ### Machine Learning
      - [Gaussian Process Classification with MCMC Sampling](https://github.com/sogofunmi/data-science-and-machine-learning-portfolio/blob/master/GP_and_MCMC.Rmd): A standard Gaussian Process model with a Metropolis sampling technique for hyperparameter tuning. 
  - ### Deep Learning
      - [Music Genre Classification System](https://github.com/sogofunmi/data-science-and-machine-learning-portfolio/blob/master/Music%20Genre%20Classification%20.ipynb): Creating a system that can classify 30-second music samples under 10 different genres.
      - [ASL Recognition System](https://github.com/sogofunmi/data-science-and-machine-learning-portfolio/blob/master/ASLRecognition.ipynb): Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network for the recognition of ASL alphabets.
